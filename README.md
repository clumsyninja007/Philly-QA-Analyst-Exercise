# Philly QA Analyst Exercise
## Installation

To run the tests for Q3, first install the pre-reqs for Cypress https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress

On Debian-based systems, install dependencies with `apt-get install libgtk2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libgbm-dev libnotify-dev libgconf-2-4 libnss3 libxss1 libasound2 libxtst6 xauth xvfb`

Will also need Node.js 12 or 14 and above

Once installed, clone this repo and move into the Q3 folder. From there, run `npm install`

Once the pre-reqs are installed, run `npx cypress open` to open the testing suite and run the tests.
