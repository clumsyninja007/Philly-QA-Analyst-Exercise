A municipality is serving the general public while a private company may be serving a more specialized group of users. There is also potentially info that needs to be found during a crisis, so it's critical that the data is highly available.

With this in mind, some common website issues I think the City of Philadelphia should be testing include:
- Page loading speed
- Page load size
  - Some people don't have access to high speed internet or have bandwidth restrictions
- Information before images
- Useful search results
- Mobile friendly
  - Also, fits different sized screens and text size/scaling options
- Not too many clicks to get where you want to go
- Ensure forms are intuitive and error-free with input validation
- Find broken links
- Compatability with different browsers
  - Fallbacks for outdated browsers
- Site security
- Accessibility
- Misc. bugs and crashes
- SEO optimizations
